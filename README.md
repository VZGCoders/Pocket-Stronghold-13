# This project is discontinued. Why?
The primary developer of the Dwarf Fortress 13 project, maxsc, in addition to refusing to moderate the Discord server for months until Discord had to step in after multiple reports from people who were given a moderator role with no actual power to enforce the server rules, has blatantly chose to go against /tg/'s licensing by making the project fully closed source. Pocket Stronghold 13 was intended to be an open source project to build upon the Dwarf Fortress 13 server, but because they refuse to open their source code to us, it has become impossible for us to stay updated. As we have no intentions of helping create content for developers that so blatantly go against the open source foundation that Byond and SS13 thrives on, we have chosen to discontinue this project while continuing to focus our efforts towards developing [Civilization 13](https://github.com/Civ13/Civ13/). Because it is not possible to compile using the original repository due to configurations that maxsc made specifically so that others could not host this server themselves, we have redacted the passwords in our configuration files and commented out the .gitignore for the relevant folders in our last commit so that anyone in the future might still be able to recover what is left of this project. Our [bot](https://github.com/VZGCoders/PS13-Bot) is already public source but requires some manual reconfiguration to work on another server.

# What is this?
Pocket Stronghold 13 is inspired by Dwarf Fortress game by Tarn and Zach Adams, using the SS13 codebase which takes the action not in space - but on the planet, in the world created by the blood god Armok. Play as one of the dwarves in the fortress, master the arts of craft and combat, build up the fortress with other dwarves to protect from the harsh outside world. But even walls can not always save you from those who lurk below.
